# KLH-Threat-Meter-17.35
Edited version of 17.35 that tracks Greater Blessing of Kings threat from casts in a raid. Requires Greater Blessing of Kings to be cast using CastSpellByName()
The behavior makes several assumptions and does not cover all possible edge cases.  Requires being in a raid to show the threat value.
